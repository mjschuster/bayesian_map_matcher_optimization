"""
Contains the code for modelling the EvaluationFunction via discrete samples.

A Sample is defined by its full set of rosparams ("complete_rosparams"), since they're necessary to run
the map matcher.
A Sample contains resulting data from the map matcher evaluation with its complete_rosparams.

The Samples are managed by the SampleDatabase, which uses a hashing to quickly find the Sample for a given complete_rosparams set.
If it doesn't exist, a new Sample will be generated using the INTERFACE_MODULE. (this is where you can define some method for generating Sample data for your specific map matcher implementation)

The EvaluationFunction differentiates "complete_rosparams" and "optimized_rosparams".
It acts as the interface for the optimizer, which only knows about the "optimized_rosparams" (subset of "complete_rosparams").
